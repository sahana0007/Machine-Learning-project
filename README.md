# Machine-Learning-project

Deep Learning was used to train a model that had noisy sinusoidal signal as input data. 
90000 samples were used to train, test, and validate the model. 
Data pre-processing and model architecture was discussed where it was explained how 
using deep neural networks such as LSTM and Bi-LSTM is trained to get around 92 - 94% 
accuracy. It was found through the metrics calculation and confusion matrix plotting 
that Bi-LSTM outperformed LSTM as it had more true positives. Even though the 
accuracy of both the models ranged between 92-94%, the model loss was lesser in BiLSTM. 
Finally, we concluded that Bi-LSTM produced better results than LSTM.
